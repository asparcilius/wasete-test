# RemWaste - Modern Skip Hire Application


### 1. Beautiful Glassmorphism Design
I've gone for a modern glassmorphism look because:
- It looks super premium and modern
- Makes the UI feel light and airy
- Keeps everything readable while looking fancy
- Perfect for a waste management service that wants to look professional

### 2. Smart Step-by-Step Flow
I've broken down the skip hire process into 3 simple steps:
1. **Location** (30 sec) - Enter your postcode
2. **Waste Type** (1 min) - Tell us what you're throwing away
3. **Skip Selection** (1 min) - Pick the perfect skip size

Why this works:
- No overwhelming choices
- Clear progress tracking
- Each step is focused and simple
- Less chance of mistakes

### 3. Real-Time Features
- Instant postcode validation
- Live skip availability checking
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Real-time price updates

### 4. Mobile-First Approach
- Works great on phones and tablets
- Touch-friendly interface
- Responsive design that adapts to any screen
- Bottom navigation for easy access
